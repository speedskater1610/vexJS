# vexJS - A port of the quick JS engine to be able to run vex robotics through vex v5 c++

## Overview

- QuickJS is a small and embeddable JavaScript engine. It aims to support the latest
[ECMAScript] specification.

This project is a _fork_ of the _fork_ [original QuickJS project] by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon, after it went dormant, with the intent of reigniting its development.
